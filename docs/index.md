# Welcome to Jetson Docs!

> Independent Jetson documentation.

Have you ever found yourself in this situation?
![tabs](./images/tabs.png)

This project started to address the frustrating experience caused by the absence of a centralized documentation to work on NVIDIA jetson platforms.

I've just started _jetson-docs_ and I will add things as I work on them, contributions are welcome :)

For anything, mail me at [hello@federicolanzani.com](mailto:hello@federicolanzani.com)
