# Welcome to Jetson Docs!

> Independent Jetson documentation.

Have you ever found yourself in this situation?
![tabs](./images/tabs.png)

This project started to address the frustrating experience of the absence of a centralized documentation to work on NVIDIA jetson platforms.

I've just started working on this and I will add things as I work on them, contributions are welcome :)

I mainly use the Jetson Nano 2GB / 4GB, but I also have access to the new Jetson Orin Nano 8GB.

The structure of this website is still work in progress, I will figure out something while adding stuff.

For anything mail me at [hello@federicolanzani.com](mailto:hello@federicolanzani.com)
