# Deepstream

⚠️ Warning:

DeepStream is a promising technology that nvidia is developing right now. It lacks of an organized structure of learning
material, and you will keep jumping between links. Because of that, unless what you want to build is close to a provided
example, you may have a frustrating experience.

I’ve wasted a lot of time jumping through resources trying to figure out how to work with DeepStream. I decided to move
away (for now), I now use opencv + gstreamer and cuda accelleration, and it does the job done very efficiently.

If you want to install it anyway, here is a
