# OpenCV docker image

[Repo GitHub](https://github.com/lanzani/opencv-jetson) | [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/federicolanzani/opencv-jetson)

If you are familiar with the jetson environment you are probably asking why I made this image and not used dustynv/opencv

The reasons are:

- I have to use opencv version 4.8.0 (in dustynv/opencv opencv version is 4.5.0)
- I wanted to have more control on the image
