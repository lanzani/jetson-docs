# Introduction

You might be interested in using various models on the Jetson, such as YOLO or MediaPipe. However, building these
libraries can be a frustrating and poorly documented experience. If you only need the model, the best solution is to use
OpenCV directly. OpenCV has a module called DNN that supports various formats. The advantage of using OpenCV is that it
is extensively documented and performs well on the Jetson.
