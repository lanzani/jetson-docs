# OpenCV

Tested on: Jetson Nano 2GB, Jetson Nano 4GB

To use the acceleration that the jetson nano provides you need to build opencv from source on jetson.

To do that I suggest [this great script](https://github.com/mdegans/nano_build_opencv)
or [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCNnqTFi-Gs).
