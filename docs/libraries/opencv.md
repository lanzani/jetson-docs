# OpenCV

## Pre-built packages

### Jetson devices

Tested on: Jetson Nano 4GB

To know more about the build flags, look at *Build from source* section below.

| Jetpack (l4t)         | Python version | OpenCV version | Package | Package source |
|-----------------------|----------------|----------------|---------|----------------|
| r32.7.1 (ubuntu18.04) | 3.6.8          | 4.8.0          |         |                |
|                       | 3.8.0          | 4.8.0          |         |                |
|                       | 3.10.11        | 4.8.0          |         |

### Install OpenCV from package

1. To install a OpenCV, you first need to download it from the table above, then run:

    ```bash
    ./OpenCV-*-aarch64.sh --prefix=/usr/local --skip-license --exclude-subdir
    ```

2. To check if the installation went good you can type:
    ```bash
    opencv_version
    ```
   The output should be the opencv_version you desired.
   ::: warning
   If you got some error, you may miss some runtime dependencies, to solve that, go to the section below.

3. To check if python has the right opencv version in the scope and to see the build details you can run:

    ```bash
    python3 -c "import cv2; print('OpenCV version:', str(cv2.__version__)); print(cv2.getBuildInformation())"
    ```

If you got some error, you may miss some runtime dependencies, to solve that, keep reading ðŸ™‚

### Check for missing runtime dependencies

## Build from source

Build

## Docker images

### Runtime
Here you can find images with opencv pre-installed.

| Jetpack (l4t)         | Python Version | OpenCV Version | Docker Image | Docker image source |
|-----------------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|---------------------|
| r32.7.1 (ubuntu18.04) | 3.6.8          | 4.8.0          |              |                     |
|                       | 3.8.0          | 4.8.0          |              |                     |

### Build images
Here you can find a table with the images used to build opencv and get the installation package.
