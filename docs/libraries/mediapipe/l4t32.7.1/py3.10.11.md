# Mediapipe GPU for Python 3.10.11

## Mediapipe docker images

::: tip HEY! ðŸ‘‹
I've made a docker container with mediapipe 0.10.7 and opencv 4.8.0 ready to
use! [Check it out](/libraries/mediapipe/overview#docker-images).

## Mediapipe 0.10.7 installation

Required time: <Badge type="info" text="15min" />

This process to install mediapipe for python 3.10 is the same of [python3.8](/libraries/mediapipe/l4t32.7.1/py3.8.0)
except for the python version used and the name of the wheel. Nevertheless I decided to keep everything nicely isolated
even if this means to be repetitive.

### Pre-requisites

**Python 3.10.11**

To install python 3.10.11 for l4t32.7.1 follow [these steps](/libraries/python/l4t32.7.1/py3.10.11), once done, come back
here.

**OpenCV**

From the tests I've made, OpenCV is needed to make everything works correctly. Don't worry, I've already built it for
you :D

Follow the steps [here](/libraries/opencv/l4t32.7.1/py3.10.11) to install opencv 4.8.0 from wheel. Then come back here.

~~**Tensorflow**~~
> Wait, no tensorflow?

Well, I've seen guides that uses it and guides that don't. I didn't install it and my setup works great and uses the
GPU.

The official mediapipe documentation says something about
it [here](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/framework/getting_started/gpu_support#tensorflow_cuda_support_and_setup_on_linux_desktop).
I suggest you to continue without installing it.

### Install mediapipe from wheel

First, update and upgrade:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
```

Download the dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y \
    libopencv-core-dev \
    libopencv-highgui-dev \
    libopencv-calib3d-dev \
    libopencv-features2d-dev \
    libopencv-imgproc-dev  \
    libopencv-video-dev
```

Upgrade pip:

```bash
python3.8 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Download the wheel file
from [here](https://github.com/lanzani/jetson-libraries/raw/main/libraries/mediapipe/l4t32.7.1/py3.10.11/mp0.10.7/mediapipe-0.10.7-cp310-cp310-linux_aarch64.whl).

or download it using wget:
```bash
wget https://github.com/lanzani/jetson-libraries/raw/main/libraries/mediapipe/l4t32.7.1/py3.10.11/mp0.10.7/mediapipe-0.10.7-cp310-cp310-linux_aarch64.whl
```

Install mediapipe:

```bash
python3.10 -m pip install mediapipe-0.10.7-cp310-cp310-linux_aarch64.whl
```

To conclude, you need to install matplotlib:

```bash
python3.10 -m pip install matplotlib
```

To test that everything properly works, try [these scripts](/libraries/mediapipe/overview#test-gpu-support).
