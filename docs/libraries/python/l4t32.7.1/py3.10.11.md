# Python 3.10.11 for L4T 32.7.1
_(Jetpack 4.6.1) (Ubuntu 18.04)_

Is not that complex, credits goes to [JetsonHacks](https://jetsonhacks.com/)
with [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSdXakt8nZ8) that comes with a great explanation.

I've made a ready-to-use docker image with python 3.10.11 already installed. Check [here](/libraries/python/overview#docker-images).
