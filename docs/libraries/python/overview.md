# Python

Python versions expires, [here](https://devguide.python.org/versions/) you can find their lifecycle.
Ubuntu versions also expires, [here](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle) you can find when.

_I thought you may find useful to have these links here :)_

::: tip
After installing a new python version, it is suggested to create a virtual environment with only the python version you
want to use to avoid conflicts.
