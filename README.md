# Jetson Docs

This project started to address the frustrating experience of the absence of a centralized documentation to work on NVIDIA 
jetson platforms. 

I've just started working on this and I will add things as I work on them, contributions are welcome :)

I mainly use the Jetson Nano 2GB / 4GB, but I also have the new Jetson Orin Nano 8GB.
